It was such good value for money. Basing it on the current reviews I was not expecting a lot yet 
when we arrived the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful, taking our bags while we 
waited for our room (we did arrive v. early) and being very hospitable. The room was spotless - clean 
sheets and towels, polished worktops, and disinfected ensuite. The power in the shower was amazeballs 
and they provided toiletries - soap, shampoo, conditioner and body wash. On leaving the room there 
was a smell of a swimming pool in the hallway and stairwell showing again a great level of cleanliness 
and disinfection. I would recommend anyone stay here ... cheap as chips, yet very high cleanliness 
standards. It's also a stones throw from the National History Museum in a lovely part of 
town - Kensington. There are lovely restaurants and supermarkets within a 1 minute walk. 
If you're into supermarkets, you'll love the nearby Waitrose! The tube station - Gloucester Rd on 
the Piccadilly line - is a 2 minute walk. From here London is your oyster!
